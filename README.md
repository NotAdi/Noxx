A [Telegram](https://telegram.org) Userbot powered by [Pyrogram](https://pyrogram.org).

## Setup
You have to obtain your personal API credentials from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org?to=apps).
Fill these into the [sample config file](noxx.ini.sample).

1. `git clone https://github.com/npv12/Noxx.git`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Copy or rename [`noxx.ini.sample`](noxx.ini.sample) to `noxx.ini` and fill it out as instructed
4. Start Noxx with `python -m noxx`

You can now log in via Pyrogram and send `.alive` to see if Noxx is working.

## Disclaimer
```Python
# Nox is a userbot that lets you automate things.
# Telegram doesn't like automation.
# If you get banned after using Noxx, this is your own responsibility.
# If you come to me whining about being banned after using Noxx, I'll just block you.


```
